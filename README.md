**Forecasting Sports Match Outcomes Using ARIMA and Neural Network Models**

**Overview**

This repository contains the implementation of a research project
focused on forecasting sports match outcomes using both traditional
statistical methods (ARIMA) and modern machine learning approaches
(Neural Networks). The study aims to evaluate and compare the
effectiveness of these models in predicting the results of sports
matches, leveraging historical data for training and testing.

**Objectives**

-   **Model Comparison:** To compare the performance of ARIMA
    (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and Neural Network models
    in predicting sports match outcomes.

-   **Accuracy Evaluation:** To evaluate the accuracy of these models
    using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error
    (MAE), and R-squared.

-   **Feature Importance:** To analyze the impact of various features
    like player statistics, team form, and historical match outcomes on
    the prediction accuracy.

-   **Model Optimization:** To optimize the Neural Network architecture
    and ARIMA parameters for enhanced predictive performance.

**Features**

-   **ARIMA Model Implementation:** Includes code for implementing and
    tuning ARIMA models for time series forecasting.

-   **Neural Network Implementation:** Includes code for building,
    training, and evaluating Neural Network models.

-   **Data Preprocessing:** Scripts for cleaning, normalizing, and
    splitting the data into training and testing sets.

-   **Model Evaluation:** Functions for calculating performance metrics
    such as MSE, MAE, and R-squared.

-   **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing predictions versus actual
    outcomes and analyzing model performance over time.
